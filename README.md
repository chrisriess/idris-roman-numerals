Presentation and code from the Munich Lambda meetup on 20 Nov 2017

Please find the slides and the respective code bits from my presentation
in this repository. The code is just about as chaotic as my talk was -
sorry 'bout that - but it should give you some hints of what I was trying
to convey in my talk...
